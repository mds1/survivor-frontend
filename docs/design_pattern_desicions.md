Taking some ideas from Vyper:
* Follow everything listed underneath "Following the principles and goals, Vyper does not provide the following features" in the Vyper documentation at https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html


Use interface + code model, with no inheritance, etc., as mentioned here: https://medium.com/@daniel.jozsef/why-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-viper-part-1-c6ba7bda02f5
