# Rules
* Create or join a Survivor pool
* Each week choose one team to win their game straight up (no point spread)
  * If they lose, you are out
  * If they win, you pick a new team next week
  * Teams can only be picked once
* If all remaining players are eliminated at once, those players all move on to the next round
* Last player remaining wins the pot
  * If there is a tie at the end of the season, the remaining players split the pot
